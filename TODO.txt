multiple clients
multiple load balanced servers

modify loadBalancedServer.py to support a parameterized amount of child threads to support communication: each of these client threads listens on the same port
modify loadBalancer.py ListThread and LoadThread to communicate. ListThread should only enable a comm thread to talk back to a client if the load is low enough

create multiple clients which each ask the load balancer for a host


refactor existing resources to keep track of how load-heavy a server is:
    one resource per server
    one thread per server with a communication link to that servers LBCommThread socket
    constantly asking it its load

OTHER method:
    one resource per server
    server pings LB when it is available to take more
    LB has one thread per server with a communication link to the LBCommThread socket
